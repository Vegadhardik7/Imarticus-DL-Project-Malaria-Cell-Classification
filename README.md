So what we end up doing is attempting to build a model that just based on the image of a cell can predict whether or not it’s infected or not infected with malaria.

In real life, this may save doctors a lot of time by just running images into our model instead of having to manually look at these image’s themselves and determinant.

### Problem Statement

**Malaria Cell Classification**

Malaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites that remains a major threat in global health, affecting 200 million people and causing 400,000 deaths a year. The main species of malaria that affect humans are Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.
